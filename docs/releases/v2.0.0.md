# v2.0.0 Modernization Notes

`v2.0.0` is a major modernization release focused on packaging, tooling, and release automation.

## Breaking Changes

- Python support is now `3.10+` (previously `3.7+`).
- Legacy Travis CI is removed in favor of GitHub Actions.
- npm distribution now uses a maintained Node wrapper that executes the Python module.

## Packaging and Dependency Updates

- Added PEP 621 metadata in `pyproject.toml`.
- Kept `setuptools` backend with a lightweight `setup.py` compatibility shim.
- Runtime dependency remains `psutil` (non-Windows) with modern marker syntax.
- Added dev dependency group for `pytest`, `ruff`, `build`, and `twine`.

## CI/CD and Release Automation

- Added `CI` workflow for linting and tests on Python 3.10-3.14.
- Added npm wrapper smoke tests on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Added release workflow with trusted publishing to PyPI.
- Added Dependabot updates for pip and npm ecosystems.

## User-Facing Stability

- CLI command names are unchanged: `pokemon` and `ichooseyou`.
- Existing command-line flags and behavior remain compatible.
